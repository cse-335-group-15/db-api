from utils import endpoint

# Use endpoint decorator to add an endpoint to the API.
# 
# The path will be whatever is after the profile name in the URL.
# So if the URL is /gwdeib01/query, the path will be 'query'.
# 
# The decorator will pass arguments from the body of the request to the function based on what it needs.
# So add parameters as neccesary to the function signature, just make sure the website actually sends those parameters.
#
# The function should return a query that will be executed on the database.
#
# Do not call these elsewhere in the code, they should only be called by the lambda_handler.
